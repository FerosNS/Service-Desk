# About the Project

###What is the reason for the creation of this application?
Bitcraft Service Desk is an idea that us developers had while working for our University Help Desk. For Software Engineering, a senior-year capstone course, we needed to come up with an idea for a piece of software, henceforth Bitcraft Service Desk was our capstone project. 

###How would I go about submitting a feature request?
On our [Github](https://github.com/bitcraft-labs/Service-Desk) there is an Issues section. In there you can submit a feature request. If a reasonable request, we may have it completed in a fair amount of time.
