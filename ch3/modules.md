# Modules
###What are modules?
**Modules** is a term used to describe the different pieces of this application. The modules in use here are as follows:
- Service Records
- Change Notifications
- Communication / Inbox
- End User Manager
- End User Portal

Each of these are the key parts in making the application function as it does. Each module interacts with each of the other ones in order to bring together this seamless application.

Each of these modules will be touched upon in their own chapters.
